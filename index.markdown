### Turbocharging [Kiva][kiva]{:target="_blank"}'s product marketing loop

![kiva](/img/kiva.png)

I created the crowdlending platform Kiva's first product marketing process, bridging the gap between Product and Marketing departments. 

This accelerated the pace of experimentation and learning for both teams and led to more product engagement.

>
Kyle was brought on to consult on some Product Marketing work at Kiva. Even though it was a brand new function, he dove right in, building trust and strong working rapport with his Product and channel marketing counterparts. 
>
In a relatively short amount of time, he was creating and running iterative tests to help inform our product build. Kyle is scrappy, hard-working, and adds valuable input to every discussion he's a part of. He's incredibly easy to work with and a joy to have on the team!

### Accelerating Solar.com beyond $2M annual revenue

![solar.com](/img/solar.com.png)

I helped to establish Solar.com as a leading authority for going solar. I used keyword research, backlink generation, and site optimization to obtain 55% quarter over quarter growth in organic search traffic. I executed 40% year over year growth in lead volume with conversion-optimized campaigns, utilizing digital, radio, print, customer referrals, email lifecycle nurturing, and affiliate partnerships.

## FAQs

### How do we work together?

Click "let's chat" on the right and we can start with a short conversation about your project. 

If we think we're a good fit, we can use my standard consulting agreement or work out an ageement that you prefer. 

I'll then track my work via Clockify and provide bi-weekly reports alongside my invoices that breakdown tasks and time spent.

### How long will you work with us?

As long as we're vibin'. I typically work on an ongoing, hourly basis with my clients until it no longer makes sense to. I'd recommend we work together for at least a few months in order for us to move beyond the onboarding/orientation phase of a new project and into real value provided.

### How many hours per week will you work with us?

I work 0-30 hours per week for each of my clients. This varies widely as the needs and timelines for startups can ramp up and down week to week. For this reason, I'll only work with a few clients at a time.

### What if our project changes?

I'm flexible! The nature of startups is change, and I can accommodate major strategy pivots. If it ever gets to a point where the scope of work has changed to a degree that warrants a discussion, I'll let you know.
