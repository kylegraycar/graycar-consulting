## I make apps that address the climate crisis

For the last 7 years I've led growth and product launch efforts at various climate tech orgs, including [Kiva][kiva], [Solar.com][solar.com], and [Decarbon][decarbon]. I'm a startup generalist, but I thrive in creating compelling user experiences, improving them with research+experimentation, and uncovering insights that inform strategy and accelerate growth. 

*I'm seeking freelance projects at early-stage organizations that are working to address the climate crisis.*

What I can do:
- Build your first MVP software product
- Migrate your MVP into a cross-platform, scalable framework
- Translate your existing desktop product to a mobile app

## Approach
1. Refine the product & growth vision
2. Identify specific hypotheses
3. Quantifiably test hypotheses
4. Iterate, scale, repeat

## Skills
Full-stack app development (flutter/firebase), product marketing, user research, AB testing

BS in Environmetal Science from UCLA

## Rate
$120/hr

## Portfolio

### From 0 to 5,000 users with [Decarbon][decarbon]

![decarbon web app](/img/decarbon-desktop.png)

I developed an iOS, Android & web app to production that automatically tracks a user's carbon emissions based on their purchases and provides personalized recommendations for taking climate action. Decarbon's grown from 0 to 5,000 users and has been [featured on ABC news][abc-feature]. 

Decarbon is built with Flutter and Firebase, and uses Stripe, Patch Climate, Plaid, Sendgrid, and other services.

I developed a touchscreen ordering interface for the Los Angeles startup TAINR. This interface is embedded into TAINR's bulk-food displensing kiosks and utilizes ReactJS, Firebase, and Stripe.

Kyle is like a Swiss Army knife for your company. Everything form marketing, website building, project management, MVP strategy and even coding, he has it all under his set of tools / skills. And the best part is that he gets it done in a productive and transparent manner -- Voicing challenges, and bringing additional resources when needed to get the job done! It is truly a pleasure to work with him and have him involved in different levels of whatever project you are working on. I strive to learn a bit everyday from him on his management methods and approach to tackling tasks. He's also a great team player and always brings the best attitude to every meeting.

### Turbocharging [Kiva][kiva]'s product marketing loop

![kiva](/img/kiva.png)

I created the crowdlending platform Kiva's first product marketing process, bridging the communication gap between Product and Marketing departments. This accelerated the pace of experimentation and learning for both teams and led to more first time depositors and recurring lenders.

Kyle was brought on to consult on some Product Marketing work at Kiva. Even though it was a brand new function, he dove right in, building trust and strong working rapport with his Product and channel marketing counterparts. In a relatively short amount of time, he was creating and running iterative tests to help inform our product build. Kyle is scrappy, hard-working, and adds valuable input to every discussion he's a part of. He's incredibly easy to work with and a joy to have on the team!

### Accelerating Solar.com beyond $2M annual revenue

![solar.com](/img/solar.com.png)

I helped to establish Solar.com as a leading authority for going solar. I used keyword research, backlink generation, and site optimization to obtain 55% quarter over quarter growth in organic search traffic. I executed 40% year over year growth in lead volume with conversion-optimized campaigns, utilizing digital, radio, print, customer referrals, email lifecycle nurturing, and affiliate partnerships.

## FAQs

### How do we work together?

Click "schedule free consultation" at the bottom of this page and we can start with a short conversation about your project. 

If we think we're a good fit, we can use my standard consulting agreement or work out an ageement that you prefer. 

I'll then track my work via Clockify and provide bi-weekly reports alongside my invoices that breakdown tasks and time spent for that period.

### How long will you work with us?

As long as we're vibin'. I typically work on a retainership basis with my clients until it no longer makes sense to. I'd recommend we work together for at least a few months in order for us to move beyond the onboarding/orientation phase of a new project and into real value provided.

### How many hours per week will you work with us?

I work 0-30 hours per week for each of my clients. This varies widely as the needs and timelines for startups can ramp up and down week to week. For this reason, I'll only work with a few clients at a time.

### What if our project changes?

I'm flexible! The nature of startups is change, and I can accomadate major strategy pivots. If it ever gets to a point where the scope of work has changed to a degree that warrants a discussion, I'll let you know.
