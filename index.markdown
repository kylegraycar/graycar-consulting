## Climate Tech Consultant
For the last 7 years I've led growth and product launch efforts for various Climate Tech organizations, including Kiva, Solar.com, and Decarbon. I'm a startup generalist, but I thrive in creating effective user experiences, improving them with experimentation, and translating those results into insights that informs strategy and accelerates growth. 

I'm seeking freelance projects at early-stage organizations that are working to address the climate crisis.

## Approach
1. Refine the product & growth vision
2. Identify specific hypotheses
3. Quantifiably test hypotheses
4. Iterate, scale, repeat

## Skills
Full-stack app development (flutter/firebase), product marketing, user research, AB testing

## Rate
$120/hr
